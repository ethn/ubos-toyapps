  context.xml file for running gladiwashere-java-mysql WITHOUT the help
  of UBOS in your local IDE, for example.

  When deployed using ubos-admin, UBOS will create a new context.xml
  file from the template file in tmpl/context.xml.tmpl so the database
  information can be unique to the instance.

  To use this configuration without the help of UBOS, you need to create
  a MySQL database yourself:
     
          create database gladiwasherejava
          grant all privileges on gladiwasherejava.* to 'specialuser'@'localhost' identified by 'specialpass';
          flush privileges;
         
  and initialize its schema:
     
           mysql gladiwasherejava < sql/create.sql
