This is the blog example app from http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html,
with some additions, so it can be packaged for UBOS and installed with a single
ubos-admin command.

It's a bit unclear what the license is for this example app. We assume it's the 
Ruby License and packaging it for UBOS is not intended to change that.
